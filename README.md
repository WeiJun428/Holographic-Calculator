HoloLens 2 AR Drawing Application

This holographic whiteboard was developed to make mathematics and drawing on digital devices feel more natural and immersive. We hoped to replicate user experiences when using physical whiteboards or paper but also allow users to access powerful computational software. We created an AR application that allows users to draw on virtual whiteboards utilizing HoloLens 2â€™s hand tracking technology. To allow users to do computations we utilized Azure Cognitive Service Optical Character Recognition (OCR) to recognize text and numbers that users drew. We sent the recognized text to Wolfram Alpha to perform and display the results of the calculations. By adding a glow effect to the virtual whiteboards on collision we were able to provide a more responsive user experience. The final application provides the basic experience of drawing and computation in Augmented Reality (AR). Each individual part such as the OCR and hand interaction can be improved on and refined for a final user product on any AR device.
